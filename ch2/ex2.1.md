# Exercise 2.1

## 1.
The code sets the value of z dependent on the conditions of x and y

If x is less than five, or greater than y, z is set to four.
Otherwise, z is set to two.

## 2.
### (a)
z = 4.0
### (b)
z = 2.0
### (c)
z = 4.0

## 3

double x, y, z;
if ((x >= y ) || (x < 5.9((
{
	z = 4.0;
}
else
{
	z  = 2.0;
}
