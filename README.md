#About this repository

I managed to make it all the way through my EE degree without really being any good at any programming language aside from MATLAB. So now as a working professional I have decided to go back an try to teach myself some C++.

My current resource is [Guide to Scientific Computing in C++, by Francis & Whiteley, 2nd ed (Springer, 2017)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781447127369)

But this process is more than just learning C++. I was aware of but never before used a source control system, so I am using git to help make me more comfortable with it (admittedly in the very limited capacity where it's basically a Dropbox folder that syncs manually).

And I'm also going to try to work with Vim as my editor because I'm apparantly a masochist.
